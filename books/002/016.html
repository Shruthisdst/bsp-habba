				<p id="id_002_016_002"><i>Navarātra</i> is a very important	<i>parva</i> in the garland of festivals of the <i>Sanātana Āryabhāratiyas</i>. There is no doubt that this is the most important of all the festivals celebrated in the <i>Āśvayujamāsa</i>. This is a festival which is specially celebrated in all parts of India. People of all <i>Āśramas</i> can celebrate this and even the <i>Mlecchās</i> who do not fully come under <i>Āryadharma,</i> are entitled (eligible) to celebrate this <i>parva</i>.</p>

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_009">There are six different <i>darśanas</i> relating to <i>Bhaktadarśana</i>, viz - <i>śaiva, vaishṇava, śākta, soura, gāṇapatya</i> and <i>kaumāra</i>. People belonging to any of these paths can celebrate <i>Navarātra</i>. Because, <i>&#x2018;Śakti&#x2019;</i> is the goddess who is specially worshiped in this <i>parva</i>. As all the <i>deities</i> of <i>bhakti pantha</i> are <i>Śaktisampannās</i> only, they will be pleased by the observance of this <i>parva</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_010"><strong>&#x201c;परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_011">As both <i>Śvetāśvataropanishat</i> and <i>Śrīmadbhāgavata</i> say, the Lord is <i>Śaktiviśishṭa</i> only.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_012"><strong>&#x201c;सञ्जीवयत्यखिलशक्तिधरस्स्वधाम्ना&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_013">This is the <i>parva</i> in which <i>Śakti</i> part of the Lord is worshipped specially. Thus, this is a <i>parva</i> which is acceptable to the people of all the <i>dharmas</i>. If it is not possible to observe this <i>parva</i> for all the nine days, it should be observed atleast on the last four days, or three days, or two days or atleast on the last day. Elders insist that at least <i>Mahāshṭamī</i> or <i>Mahānavamī</i> should be celebrated and the festival should never go uncelebrated. Such is this great <i>Parva</i> called <i>Navarātramahotsava</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_014">This festival is called by two famous names viz. <i>Navarātra</i> and <i>Durgotsava</i>. This is also called <i>Daśāha</i> of <i>Dasarā</i> by including the <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> which is the tenth day. The name <i>&#x2018;Navarātra&#x2019;</i> matches this well as (the festival is) completed in nine nights, or nine days and nights. Even if it is not fully observed on all the nine days, or even if celebrated inclusive of <i>Viajadaśamī</i> on the tenth day, this festival is technically called <i>Navarātra</i> only. It is quite conforming to the <i>śāstras</i> to term the nine days beginning from the <i>Prathamā</i> of the <i>Caitramāsa śuklapaksha</i> as <i>Vasantanavarātra</i> and the nine days beginning from the <i>Prathamā</i> of <i>Śaratkāla</i> as <strong>&#x201c;शरद्वसन्तयोस्तुल्य एव दुर्गोत्सवः कार्यः&#x201d;</strong> But, as the <i>Navarātra</i> celebrated in the <i>śaratkāla</i> has special significance, the custom of calling that alone as <i>Navarātra</i> is in vogue. And as <i>Durgādevī</i> is worshipped in different forms viz., <i>Lakshmī, Sarasvatī</i> and <i>Durgā</i>, the name <i>Mahotsava</i> is also justified.</p> 
				<p id="id_002_016_015"><i>&#x201c;Navarātra</i> is a festival which brings in freshness to life. Worship the <i>Śuddha Prakṛtimāta</i> as <i>Lakshmī</i> in the first three days, as <i>Sarasvatī</i> in the next three days, and as <i>Gaurī</i> or <i>Durgā</i> in the last three days, and purify your dispositions. The sky outside will be clear without clouds and within also, it is a clear <i>Jnānākaśa</i>. Outside, lotuses are in full blossom and inside in the <i>Mānasa sarovara</i>, lotuses in the form of heart etc. blossom. Worship the goddess there, who is the <i>parāprakṛti</i> of the Lord and become <i>Śuddhasattvas</i>. Outside, it is plenty with <i>Dhana</i> and <i>Dhānya</i>. Inside it is the plenty of <i>Ātmadhana</i>. Outside, it is the expedition of the <i>Vīrakshatrīyas</i> for the victory of <i>Dharma</i>, and inside it is the expedition for <i>Ātmavijaya</i>. All these are combined in this <i>Mahāparva&#x201d;</i>—<strong>This was the great command of <i>ŚrīRaṅgaguru</i> given in the very best messge proclaiming the significance of this Parva and we humbly remember it here.</strong> Though this period is excellent for the meditation and <i>Upāsana</i> of all deities, it is a time very helpful for the propritiation of <i>Śaktidevatā</i>. When suitable <i>tithi, vāra, nakshatra, yoga, karaṇa</i> etc can not found on other days, the custom of celebrating auspicious functions like marriage, <i>upanayana</i> etc during <i>Navarātra</i> is in vogue, without worrying much about those features like suitable<i> tithi, vāra</i>, <i>nakshatra, yoga, karaṇa</i> and <i>grahamaitri</i>, etc. Especially the day of <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> has that great <i>Mahimā</i>, people say. This greatness is associated with <i>Navarātra</i>, as it is blessed with the special presence of <i>Durgā Devī</i> who makes people cross all <i>durgas</i>. The etymology of the word <i>Durgā</i> is, the one who makes people cross <i>Durgas</i> or, the one who prevents people from <i>Durgati&#x201d;</i>, they say.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_025">The goddess who is worshipped mainly during <i>Śarannavarātrī</i> festival is <i>&#x2018;Śakti&#x2019;</i>. <i>Jnānis</i> say that during those nine days, she should be worshiped in the form of <i>Lakshmī</i> in the first three days, <i>Sarasvatī</i> in the next set of three days, and in the form of <i>Pārvatī</i> in the last three days. Of late we are coming across many arguments pertaining to that deity which bewilder one&#x2019;s mind and cause vexations in performing her <i>pūjā</i>. Here we shall discuss them briefly, and try to provide suitable answers to them. </p>
				<p id="id_002_016_026">1. &#x201c;This <i>Durgi</i> is not at all an Aryan <i>devatā</i>. She was worshipped by Dravidas. The Aryans who came from outside, fought fierce wars with the Dravidians and occupied their land. In course of time the two cultures merged, and Aryans took some aspects and included them in their <i>Dharma</i> and <i>Samskṛti</i>. <i>Śakti</i> is one such goddess who was taken by the Aryans from the Dravidians.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_027">Basically <i>Śakti</i> is not at all a deity of Aryans. Because, Aryans worshipped only male gods. Worshipping of <i>Matṛdevatās</i> is a <i>Dravidian</i> practice.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_028">The smaller deities now, called <i>&#x201c;grāmadevatās&#x201d;</i> belong to the <i>Dravidian</i> pantheon&#x201d; This is one of the arguments put forward by critics.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_029">2. This <i>Śakti devatā</i> has form and qualities which are ferocious. She is a deity who consumes liquor and meat.</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_030">

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_038"><i>&#x201c;Sāttvikas</i> should not worship her&#x201d; is an another argument.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_039">Let us examine these two arguments.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_040">1. The argument that <i>Śakti</i> is the goddess of Dravidians and not that of Aryans is ridiculous. How can <i>devatās</i> be categorized as gods and goddesses of Aryans and Dravidians? They are forces residing inside of all the living beings and rule their lives. Can the wise say that they rule only the Dravidians and not Aryans?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_041">The very classification such as Aryan deities and Dravidian deities is ridiculous and is akin to classifying the Sun as the Aryan Sun and the Dravidian sun. This theory of classification of deities has emerged from a wrong notion that the gods are the products of mere imaginations. But in reality, if <i>Dhyāna</i> and <i>Upāsanā</i> are done, all can have the visualisation of these <i>devatāviśeshas</i> is different parts of the body. This is the universal truth. The question that there are separate gods for Aryans, Dravidians and Negros does not arise here at all.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_042">The argument that Aryans did not worship <i>Mātṛdevatās</i> is also not based on <i>śāstraic</i> truth. Because in <i>Sanātana Vaidic</i> literature, we come across praises of female deities also, like the praises of male deities such as <i>Indra</i>, <i>Agni, Varuṇa</i> etc. Both are welcome contextually. The argument that there was no prominence to female deities, just because of the fact that hymns pertaining to female deities are fewer, cannot be accepted either. Female deities such as <i>Aditi</i> and <i>Sarasvatī</i> are praised as <i>Parādevatās</i> indeed in vedic hymns.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_043">All the worlds, all deities, all creatures and all relatives are <i>Aditi</i> herself. There is none else other than her.</p>

				</p>
				﻿<p id="id_002_016_049"><i>&#x201c;Sarasvatī</i> is not just a flowing river. She is the inspirer of all beautiful words, and noble ideas. She is invited in <i>yajnas</i> conducted by <i>sukṛtis</i>, and receives the worship. She is the <i>parādevatā</i> who grants anything desired for&#x201d;—These ideas are very clearly expressed in the <i>Vedamantras</i>.</p>

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_058">When the <i>Vedas</i> of the <i>Āryamaharshis</i>, the most ancient literature, clearly proclaim the prominence of female goddesses, arguments such as &#x201c;Female deities belong to Dravidians. Aryans worshipped only male gods. Though some female deities are seen the <i>Vedas</i>, their place is only secondary&#x201d; etc, amount only to the glorification of the height of ignorance.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_059">2. Again, to argue that <i>&#x201c;Śakti devatā</i> has a ferocious form and she is worshipped with wine and meat, and therefore <i>Sāttviks</i> should not worship her, are also not the words of the wise. Though the form of some deities appear ferocious to the external eyes, they are visualized as being beautiful and bestowing bliss and peace, in deep meditation. This is not the <i>&#x2018;Rudrasaundarya&#x2019;</i>, stated by some modern literateurs. It is a divine form described by <i>yogis</i> as <strong>&#x2018;परमनयनोत्सव कारणम्&#x2019;</strong> (a feast to the eys)</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_060">As a matter of fact, <i>Parādevatās</i> consume only the <i>Amṛtānanda</i>. Whatever the devotees offer according to their disposition, be it fruits or flowers, vegetarian or nonvegetarian food, they get transformed into <i>Amṛta</i> and only after that they become an offering to the deities.</p> 
				<p id="id_002_016_061">Though <i>rākshasa</i> and <i>tāmasa</i> devotees worship <i>devī</i> with wine and meat, <i>sāttvikas</i> should worship her with <i>japa, yajna</i> and vegetarian <i>naivedya</i> only.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_074">Therefore the suggestion that <i>Sāttvikas</i> should not worship <i>Devi</i> stands to no reason.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_075">So, how should the <i>Navarātra</i> of the <i>Śaratkāla</i> be celebrated? What do <i>śāstras</i> and traditions say about the religious austerities pertaining to that? We shall explain the matter briefly here.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_076">The time of <i>Navarātra</i> of this <i>Śaratkāla</i> is the most auspicious time for the worship of God. It may be generally remembered that dispositions within and without will be most congenial for the pleasantness of the deities in this season. Much of this period should be mostly made use of for the worship of the deity in different modes such as <i>Dhyāna, japa, homa, Pārāyaṇa</i> singing of <i>stotras</i> etc. Who is the deity to be worshipped? Scriptural treatises say that it is one&#x2019;s <i>Kuladevatā</i> and <i>Jaganmāta</i>, especially the one who is the form of <i>Lakshmī, Sarasvatī</i> and <i>Durgā</i>.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_081">The <i>pūjākalpas</i> pertaining to the worship of <i>Devas</i> and <i>Devīs</i> during these days are many. The traditions and customs of worship have many variants in different provinces. We see that During <i>Navarātra</i> the following activities generally take place in all parts of the country and in all the traditions.

				<p id="id_002_016_263">&#x201c;Can we offer animals as sacrifice to gods? <i>Śāstras</i> offer various kinds of opinions; some in favour of the practice and some against it. And, some concessions are offered to some people. Why is this so?&#x201d; - To this question, some reply as follows:-</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_264">&#x201c;It was common among ancient Aryans to offer meat as <i>naivedya</i> to gods. They were under the impression that <i>tiryak</i> animals (the ones which walk horizontally unlike humans who walk straight) like sheep, buffaloes etc. have no <i>cetana</i>. And only humans are <i>cetanas</i>. Therefore if this <i>tiryak</i> animal is killed it won&#x2019;t be a sin&#x201d;. Later, by the influence of Buddhism and Jainism, the <i>samskāra</i> of nonviolence spread in them also. And they started preaching that <i>yajnas</i> should be performed with grains, fruits and cow produces only. This is the Hindu literature of the Post <i>Jaina Bauddha</i> period&#x201d;.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_265">This explanation is not correct. Because, Vedic <i>Maharshis</i> knew very well that even birds, beasts and plants are <i>cetanās</i> and <i>Vedas</i> themselves provide evidence for this. The <i>Ṛgveda</i> says that the cow is the mother of <i>Rudra</i> and the daughter of <i>vasus</i>.  <strong>(माता रुद्राणां दुहिता वसूनाम्)</strong>. <i>Yajurveda</i> makes the following prayer addressing the <i>darbhas</i>:—</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_266">﻿<strong>(&#x201c;मात्वान्वक्, मा तिर्यक् पर्वतेराध्यासमाच्छेत्ता ते मारिषम्&#x201d;)</strong>  &#x201c;I shall do not cut you crosswise, I shall not cause pain to your knots. I shall collect you as per precepts, for the purpose of <i>yajna</i>. Please do not cause my destruction&#x201d; <i>Smṛtis</i> have set procedures for collecting <i>darbha</i> and <i>Tulasi</i>. One has to salute them before collecting them, get their permission and collect only the quantity necessary for the <i>yajna</i> or <i>pūja</i>. Therefore the argument that the Aryans were under the impression that tiryak animals have no <i>cetana</i> at all is not correct. There was no need for Hindus to learn the concept of non-violence from Buddhists and Jains who came at a later time. The <i>Vedas</i> themselves proclaim</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_267">﻿<strong>(न च हिंस्यात्सर्वाभूतानि&#x201d;)</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_268">&#x201c;No animal should be subjected to pain&#x201d;. This very idea was preached with emphasis in the <i>Jaina</i> and <i>Bauddha matas</i> which came later. <i>Jains</i> are <i>&#x2018;ahimsāśūras&#x2019;</i>. They over argue the case. Even though <i>Buddhists</i> condemn the killing of animals in sacrifices and make heroic vows in this regard, they are non-vegetarians in practice.. They argue &#x201c;We do not kill animals. We eat the meat of the animals killed by others and it is not a sin&#x201d;. They have forgotten the ordinary truth that those who eat meat cause the killing of animals (at least) indirectly though not directly. Thus, it is only in vedic culture the matter of violence and non-violence is given a discerning thought and norms which are practicable have been preached.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_269">The <i>Manusmrti</i> says &#x201c;One has to live a life without causing pain to any animal. If it is not possible, violence should be limited to the minimum and violence may be resorted to only when it is unavoidable. <strong>&#x201c;अद्रोहेणैव भूतानां अल्पद्रोहेण वा पुनः&#x201d;</strong> As is evident from <strong>&#x201c;जीवो जीवस्य भोजनम्&#x201d;</strong> no creature can live without consuming another as food. Whether the food consumed is vegetarian or nonvegetarian, life cannot go on without violence. This is because even plants are <i>cetanas</i>. But this <i>caitanyaŚakti</i> will be more in animals than in plants. It will be still more in human beings. Among men it will be very high in <i>jnānis</i>. Therefore violence on animals is more sinful than violence on plants. Violence on human beings is still more sinful. And it becomes clear that causing pain to a <i>brahmajnāni</i> is the worst type of a sin. Therefore <i>maharshis</i> preached that vegetarian food is better than non-vegetarian food. which is obtained by killing <i>tiryak</i> animals.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_270">Our sages knew that even while preparing vegetarian food, pain was definitely being caused to living beings. To offset this, they prescribed the <i>pañcamahāyajnās</i>. Worship of gods and serving guests also come under <i>pañchamahāyajnās</i>. (A stone mortar, a stove, a grinding stone, sweeping, cleansing the ground and collecting water—At these five places unavoidable pain is caused. These are called <i>Pañcasūnāsthānas</i>. In order to get relieved of this <i>Sūnādosha</i>, the <i>gṛhasthas</i> have prescribed the performing of <i>Brahmanyajnā, Devayajna, Pitṛyajna</i>. <i>Bhūtayajna</i> and <i>Manushya yajna</i> (<i>atithi pūjā</i>) by the <i>śāstras</i>). Thus, preparing food in this <i>yajnarūpa</i> and consuming it causes no sin. As all the things used in this process are offered to God, <i>sadgati</i> shall be there say the <i>śāstras</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_271"><strong>&#x201c;यज्ञार्थं पशवः सृष्टाः&#x201d;</strong> It is the good fortune of <i>dravyas</i> if they happen to be of use in a <i>yajna</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_272">It is already stated above that vegetarian food is better than non vegetarian food. But there will be not blemish if non-vegetarians offer to God the food they eat before consuming it.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_273">On the other hand, if they do not do so, more blemish is caused. Whatever is the food for a person, the same will be the food for his deities also.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_274"><strong>&#x201c;यदन्नःपुरुषो भवति तदन्नास्तस्य देवताः&#x201d;</strong> It is propitious for him to consume (it as) <i>devatāprasāda</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_275">Eating meat is not a great sin, but to give it up is most great, says <i>Manu</i>.</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_276">
					﻿न मांसभक्षणे दोषः न मद्ये न च मैथुने।<br />
					﻿प्रवृत्तिरेषा भूतानां निवृत्तिस्तु महाफला ॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_280">Among <i>vaidika maharshis</i> not all were non-vegetarians. There was a large number of vegetarians also among them. Even with regard to the non-vegetarians, there was a rule that <i>brahmacāris</i>, <i>vānaprasthas</i> and <i>sanyāsis</i> should not eat meat. Even those who ate meat, were bound by certain rules which stated that they should not eat meat on certain days of a week; Even while eating they should do it in the form of a <i>yajna</i>, and that they should eat only after <i>devatā pūja</i> and the offering of <i>dānas</i>. On the whole, when we study the <i>śāstras</i>, we understand that our <i>maharshis</i> as a rule favoured the conduct of totally abstaining from meat, or partially abstaining and restricting it&#x2019;s consumption.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_281">In the <i>Itihāsa</i> and <i>purāṇas</i> we read the description of the great <i>yajnas</i> that were performed by our <i>jnāni-maharshis</i>. Some of them did involve animal sacrifice. &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t violence caused to animals on such occasions?&#x201d;—This question comes up naturally. If violence is going to be caused to <i>Yajna Paśus</i> in a sacrifice by the performers, such persons should not take up a <i>yajna</i> at all. If they perform <i>yajna</i> in that way, they will become sinners even if they chant <i>vedamantras</i>, <i>śāstras</i> say. This is because, <i>yajna</i> is also called <i>&#x2018;adhvara&#x2019;</i> which means non-violence. So, any activity which causes violence can never be a <i>yajna</i>. A <i>yajna</i> will be acceptable to <i>śāstras</i> only if both i.e. the <i>yajamāna</i> who performes the <i>yajna</i> without causing any violence, and the <i>yajnadravya</i> (i.e.the animal sacrificed) are led to <i>sadgati</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_282">How can a <i>yajnaPaśu</i> like a horse or a goat can attain <i>sadgati</i>? As they are not endowed with <i>jnāna</i> like men, they cannot obtain <i>Sadgati</i> by their own accomplishments. But if the person who performs a <i>yajna</i> happens to be a <i>brahmajnāni</i>, he can help the animal attain <i>Sadgati</i> by the power of his penance. If a person without such a power claims that he can provide <i>sadgati</i> to the animal he sacrifices in a <i>yajna</i>, it is like a man promising others to take them across a river, while he himself remains unable to cross it.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_283"><strong>&#x201c;स्वयं तरितुमक्षमः किमितरानसौ तारयेत्&#x201d;</strong>. The <i>yajna</i> he performs will only be a <i>Yajna</i> in name only culminating only in the violence of killing the animal.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_284">&#x201c;Let us assume for a moment that a <i>maharshi</i> who is a <i>jnāni</i> can make the <i>yajnaPaśu</i> obtain <i>sadgati</i> by the power of his penance. But, does not the animal suffer from pain when it is being sacrificed?&#x201d; No. Because he possesses a power by which he can provide a divine state to that animal in which no pain is caused. <strong><i>ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru</i> used to give the analogy of (a doctor) conducting a surgery after administering chloroform to the patient.</strong> By this, not only the person undergoing surgery does not experience any pain, but also regains energy after the surgery.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_285">If persons who do not possess such powers happen to offer a <i>Paśubali</i>, it will end up only as a mockery of a <i>yajna</i>. Instead of <i>&#x2018;Adhvara&#x2019;</i> it becomes a <i>&#x2018;dhvara&#x2019;</i> and instead of <i>Sadgati</i>, only <i>durgati</i> is caused (to the animal).</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_286">We have thus given a long explanation to the <i>Paśubaliyajna</i> that was being performed by a few <i>Mahātmas</i> in the past. Even then, <i>jnanis</i> say that a <i>yajna</i> performed with a <i>Paśu</i> in the form of a <i>Sasyadravya</i> is better than a <i>yajna</i> done with <i>Paśu</i>, and <i>jnānyajna</i> is better than <i>dravyayajna</i>. <strong>&#x201c;श्रेयान् ﻿द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञात् ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_287">Even in a <i>Paśubali yajna</i>, a <i>Paśu</i> selected randomly cannot be selected. The <i>Paśu</i> which has the capacity to procreate is forbidden. It should not be taken by force. It should come happily on its own. If an animal without these features is forcibly brought and sacrificed, it will lead to only undesirable results.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_288">The <i>Paśu</i> used in <i>Devīpūjā</i>, be it an bird or an animal, should always be a male. It should never be a female, say the <i>śāstras</i>. <strong>&#x201c;स्त्रियं न दद्यात्तु बलिं दत्वा  ﻿नरकमाप्नुयात्&#x201d;</strong> What is the reason for this rule? Some people put forth the argument saying that <i>Devī</i> is a female deity and so it amounts to an offence against her if a female animal is offered as a <i>bali</i>. It is not right. Because, this leads to the conclusion that a male animal should not be sacrificed as a <i>bali</i> in the (<i>yajna</i> of a) male deity, and only a female animal should be given as a bali. Only the rules in the <i>śāstras</i> can provide the discrimination to decide which animal&#x2019;s body (male or female) is <i>Bhogya</i> to a particular deity and the disposition that is caused thereby to obtain the grace of a particular deity. </p>
				<p id="id_002_016_289">One more important thing has to be noted here. There is no hard and fast rule that all should offer a <i>Paśubali</i> in the worship of <i>Durgādevī</i>. Animal sacrifice is done only in <i>Rājasa</i> and <i>Tāmasapūjās</i>. In a <i>sāttvika pūjā</i>, worship gets accomplished with mere <i>Sasyadravyas</i>. <i>Sāttvikapūja</i> alone is the best.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_298">In <i>sāttvika pūjās</i>, deliberations like <i>japa yajna</i> etc will be more. <i>Naivedya</i> will be only of vegetarian items. Here <i>japa</i> means <i>Pārāyaṇa</i> of <i>Devimāhātmya</i> with devotion and concentration as stated in the <i>purāṇas</i>. In <i>Rājasapūjās</i>, <i>Paśubali</i> will be there. The <i>naivedya</i> offered will be some items with meat. In <i>Tāmasapūjās</i> it is all liquor and meat. There will be no <i>japa yajnas</i> in it.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_299">But, in a <i>tāttvika</i> sense, <i>Paśubali</i> will be very much there even in all <i>Sāttvika devatā pūjās</i>. Inside us, well fed beasts in the form of <i>Kāma</i> and <i>Krodha</i> etc are roaming freely. Those who sacrifice them and please the deity shall become <i>Mahātmas</i> indeed endowed with <i>Ātmaguṇas</i>. To put in a nutshell, it is best to perform <i>Devīpūjā</i> without <i>Paśubali</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_300">But if the non-vegetarians offer a <i>Paśu</i> endowed with suitable features in the prescribed manner with faith and devotion, it wont be a sinful act. But everyone has to sacrifice the beasts of <i>kama</i> and <i>Krodha</i> etc. in the worship of <i>Devī</i>. Otherwise <i>Devī</i> will not be pleased. <i>Yajna</i> performed of that kind which pleases <i>Jaganmātā</i> is the best. Because, it makes us qualified for the <i>Jnānayajna</i> itself.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_301">&#x201c;It is true that in <i>Rājasapūjās</i> offered to <i>Devī</i>, animal sacrifice is prescribed. It is not proper to redicule—&#x201c;Does <i>Devi</i> eat meat and such other items like sediment offered to her?&#x201d; Certainly she does not eat them. She does not eat <i>laddus</i> or <i>jilebis</i> either. She is always full of bliss and blesses the devotees with their desires. The devotees of <i>sāttvika, Rājasa</i> and <i>tāmasa</i> dispostions worship her in a way natural to them. The type of <i>Bali</i> prescribed above is decided on what should be the <i>Naivedya</i> and the appropriate <i>prasāda</i> for a particular form worship, and what fosters the accomplishment of desires. This should be noted with discernment. What authority do we have to make a rule that all devotees should do only <i>sāttvika pūja</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_302">This discussion regarding <i>Paśubali</i>, though a little elaborate and digressive, has been presented here with a view that it will be useful in understanding the science of similar <i>vaidik</i> and <i>tāntrik</i> worships.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_303">As part of this <i>Vrata</i>, the <i>vṛksha pūjā</i> is an important aspect which has been criticized much. And so, we would like to discuss it here,</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_304">Question 1: &#x201c;The <i>ĀryaBhāratīyamaharshis</i> were mainly worshippers of nature. They were influenced by the thunder, lightning, rains, wind, light etc. which occur in nature and stir up feelings like fear, wonder, jubiliation etc. and so, attributing divinity to them, they began to worship them with prayers and sacrifices. The worship of trees also comes under this category. Gigantic trees attracted them. They were attracted by their produce such as shade, flowers, fruits and medicines and furniture, and firewood made from their timber. The houses of <i>Vaidik</i> Aryans were generally built with timber only. In the <i>Viśvakarma Sūkta</i> in the <i>Vedas</i>, we come across a sentence:-</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_305"><strong>&#x201c;किग्ग्ंस्विद्वनं क उ स वृक्ष आसीद्यतो द्यावापृथिवी निष्पतक्षुः&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_306">which means—&#x201c;from which forest and from which trees did <i>Viśvakarma</i> build this world?&#x201d;</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_307">Thus, the vedic <i>Ṛshis</i> began to worship the trees which made an impact on their hearts as deities. The same tradition continues in Indians even in this twentieth century&#x201d; This is the opinion of most of the western critics. Many Indian scholars who are their <i>mānasaputras</i> proclaim the same theory. Is this interpretation correct?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_308">Answer: This interpretation appears well reasoned superficially. But it is actually without any substance. The reason is, our great <i>Maharshis</i> were <i>ātmopāsakas</i>. They worshipped <i>caitanya</i>. They never worshipped <i>jaḍaprakṛti</i> separate from that.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_309"><strong>&#x201c;आत्मैव महय्यः आत्मत्येवतु उपगच्छन्ति&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_310">Question 2: Aryans used to worship wind, light, stones, soil, trees and water. Are these not forms of inert nature?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_311">Answer The <i>Maharshis</i> used these forms of inert nature and also living beings like men, birds and beasts as a medium for worship of God and worshipped God alone through them.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_312">Question 3: What is the basis for this explanation?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_313">Answer: Their (i.e. the <i>Maharshis&#x2019;</i>) very experience is the supreme proof. Their <i>śāstravākyas</i> also proclaim this opinion. <i>Paramātma</i> is the <i>ātmasvarūpi</i> for everything. All the <i>cetanas</i> and <i>acetanas</i> are like his body of God.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_314"><strong>&#x201c;ऐतदात्म्यमिदग्ं सर्वम्” जगत्सर्वं शरीरं ते।&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_315">—Proclaim the <i>Upanishads</i> and <i>Itihāsas</i> indeed!</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_316">Question 4: The world which consists of <i>Cetanas</i> and <i>acetanas</i> may be like the body of God.How can the worship of these please God?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_317">Answer: Doesn&#x2019;t the <i>ātman</i> feel happy when the sandal paste is anointed on the body? In the same way, if mother nature who is like the body of God, and infinite creatures are worshipped with <i>viveka</i> and <i>saṅkalpa</i>, God feels happy. This itself is proclaimed in the <i>Ahirbudhnya samhitā</i> thus-</p>

					﻿चराचराणि भूतानि सर्वाणि भगवद्वपुः।<br />

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_322">(All <i>bhūtakoṭis</i> form the body of <i>Bhagavān</i>. Therefore we have to worship them. This is indeed the conclusion.)</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_323">Question 5: In that case only humans could be taken as the <i>dvāra</i> and be worshipped, isn&#x2019;t it? Why then these viz. fire, wind, water, light, plants, and creepers were taken as <i>dvāras</i>?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_324">Ans: There is also a system of worshipping god through humans. They have called it <i>manushya yajna</i> and have prescribed it as an obligation. And, as fire, wind, the sun, water,trees etc are the great <i>vibhūtis</i> of God, they worshipped the Lord of the universe through them also and preached the same to the world also. This is indeed another important form of worshipping <i>caitanya</i>, and not the worship of <i>jaḍaprkṛti</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_325">Question 6: Plants, trees and creepers are <i>acetanās</i>. What is special about in taking them as <i>dvārās</i> for the worship of God?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_326">Ans: They are not <i>acetanās</i>. They also are living beings like humans, birds and animals. They too have <i>dharmas</i> like eating, natural growth, capacity to procreatre etc. Not just that. They too have feelings of pleasure and pain. They also have emotions like gratitude, anger etc. This is confirmed by some recent scientific research.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_327">Question 7: It is a fact proven by modern research. Did the ancient <i>Ṛshis</i> who prescribed the worship of trees and <i>vanaspatīs</i> know this?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_328">Ans: Yes, certainly they knew this. &#x201c;Plants have consciousness inside They can sense happiness and pain&#x201d;</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_329"><strong>﻿अन्तस्संज्ञा भवन्त्येते सुखदुःखादि संयुताः&#x201d;</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_330">—says the <i>manusmṛti</i>. We come across <i>vedamantras</i> which very clearly address the trees and plants as follows:-</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_331"><strong>&#x201c;अच्छेत्ता ते मारिषम् ।  ﻿शतवल्शं विरोह सहस्र वल्शाः&#x201d;</strong> states a <i>yajurvedamantra</i> in the beginning chapters. It is addressed to <i>darbha</i>, a <i>vibhūti</i> of the Lord in the plant form.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_332">&#x201c;O <i>Tuḷasi</i>, your origin is divine. You are very dear to <i>Keśava</i>. I am picking a few leaves of yours to offer to him. Please forgive me&#x201d;.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_333"><strong>&#x201c;तुलस्यमृतजन्मासि सदा त्वं केशवप्रिये&#x201d;  &#x201c;आराधनार्थं  ﻿पुरुषोत्तमस्य लुनामि पत्रं तुलसि क्षमस्व&#x201d;</strong> is the prayer of the <i>Āgamas</i> to <i>Tulasīmātā.</i></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_334">Question 8: They could be poetic words in which the <i>cetanatva</i> has been attributed to <i>acetanas,</i> isn&#x2019;t it?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_335">Ans: Certainly no. If they were just poetical words, <i>Smṛtis</i> would not lay down rules such as <i>&#x201c;Sanyāsis</i> should not pick flowers from plants and trees, and if they do so they will be gripped by <i>himsādosha</i>. Even others should collect them only for the purposes of <i>yajnas</i> and <i>pūjas</i>. A <i>yati</i> who is <i>jnānanishṭha</i> should never pick flowers and leaves from plants&#x201d;. Like birds and animals, plants are also <i>janmaviśeshas</i>. But they are <i>tāmasayonis</i>. It should be noted that the <i>smrtis</i> proclaim &#x201c;One who commits the worst possible sin will be born as a tree in a cemetery&#x201d;. &#x201c;Trees whose flowers and fruits are used for <i>pūjas</i> and <i>yajnas</i>, will get <i>sadgati</i> or will be born as a good being&#x201d;. So, it is clear that trees and <i>vanaspatīs</i> are <i>cetanās</i> only and the <i>cetanatva</i> in them is not attributed by poets.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_336">Question 9: Even then, trees and <i>vanaspatis</i> belong to a lower category among living beings. They are <i>sthāvaras</i> and <i>Tāmasa yonis</i>. Then why should they (or God through them) be worshipped?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_337">Ans: <i>Śāstras</i> have not prescribed the worship of all plants, and trees. <i>Jnānis</i> have preached to treat only such trees as <i>dvāras</i> for the worship of God, which have in them an exceptional presence of divinity, which are bestowed with a special grace of their presiding deities, and those which possess an extraordinary power to remedy the three <i>tāpas</i> viz <i>Ādhibhautika, Ādhidaivika</i> and <i>Ādhyātmikatāpas</i>, and bless with <i>Purushārthas</i>. They have recommended to worship them as <i>Mahavibhūtis</i> of God. As the <i>bilva, Śamī</i> and <i>aparājitā vṛkshas</i> which are worshipped in the <i>Navarātra vijayadaśamī</i> festivals belong to this class of sacred trees, <i>jnānis</i> have prescribed their worship as a part of the worship of gods and goddesses.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_338">Question 10: It is said above that <i>ŚrīJaganmātā</i> should be invoked in the <i>bilva</i> tree and worshipped. A twig of it is to be brought home and worshipped. What are the great qualities this tree possesses, to make it revered?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_339">Ans: When viewed from the <i>ādhibhautika</i> aspect, <i>bilva vṛksha</i> can control the <i>tridoshas</i>. &#x201c;It is <i>Balakara</i>, <i>rucikara</i>, <i>dīpaka, tāpanāśaka</i> and removes <i>pittajvara</i> and <i>atisāra&#x201d;</i> says<i> Rājanighanṭu</i>. Among these even the sight of <i>bilva vṛksha</i>, its shade and the inhalation of air around it, can cure <i>pitta</i> and a few other ailments partially.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_340">The other names of this tree such as <i>Śiva, Vishṇu, Vijaya, puṇya Śivapriya, Devāvāsa, tīrthapada, pāpaghna, trinayana, śuddhavarṇa, samyamī</i> and <i>śrāddha devatā</i> etc emphasize the divine association and sacredness of this tree.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_341"><i>&#x201c;Kāmadhenu</i> is called <i>Śrīh</i>, and <i>Lakshmīh</i>. This divine tree was born from the <i>gomaya</i> (dung) of <i>Kamadhenu</i> that incarnated on earth. <i>ŚrīDevi</i> was born in this tree&#x201d;.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_349">says <i>Śrīsūkta</i> addressing the <i>Jaganmātā</i>. Hence this is a <i>ŚrīVriksha</i>. The following <i>śloka</i> also expresses the above said idea of <i>Vahnipurāṇa</i>.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_383">The statement that the <i>tridaḷas</i> of the <i>bilva</i> are <i>BrahmaVishṇuŚivātmaka</i> is not just a eulogistic remark. <strong><i>Mahāyogeśvara Śrī Raṅga Gurudeva</i> in a <i>pūjā pravacana</i> at a <i>Sudharmāsabhā</i> at the <i>Ashṭaṅgayoga Vijnāna Mandira</i> in Bangalore demonstrated scientifically how each of the three leaves in the tridalatouches the corresponding <i>mūrti</i>, how they produce the particular reaction in the realm of the nādi of each deity, and how they make the respective deity-centres blossom.</strong> That was a thrilling experience and it is still green in our memory. And so, we have not an iota of doubt in this regard.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_384">Though it is very dear to all gods and goddesses, it is exceptionally dear to <i>Śiva</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_385"><strong>﻿प्रियो हं सर्वदेवानां त्रिनेत्रस्य विशेषतः</strong></p>
				<p id="id_002_016_386">There is a tradition to offer <i>bilva</i> mixed with <i>Tuḷasi</i> in the worship of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> also. In <i>Tirupati</i>, Lord <i>Venkaṭeśvara</i> is offered <i>bilva</i> along with <i>Tulasi</i>. <i>Śrī Śaṅkarabhagavatpāda</i> in his work <i>&#x2018;Bhagavanmānasa pūja&#x201d;</i> which is a <i>SriKṛshṇa mānasa pūja stuti</i> says <strong>&#x201c;बिल्वतुलसीयुतैश्चेमं पुष्पाञ्जलिमजित ते ﻿मूर्ध्नि निदधे&#x201d;</strong> extolling the combination of <i>Bilva</i> and <i>Tuḷasi</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_387">As this is the dearest <i>Śrīvṛksha</i> to <i>Śrīdevi, Śrīvaishṇavas</i> customarily store the sacred <i>Śrīcurṇa</i>, a powder which is yellow or saffron in colour used for wearing on the forehead, in a small container made from the <i>bilva</i> fruit.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_388">Thus <i>Śrī Bilva Vṛksha</i> being an abode of the deities, helps one to have good health, removes mental agony and creates <i>dhāthu sāmya</i>, happens to be a <i>mahāvibhūti</i> of the alimighty. It is very relevent to invoke and worship <i>Śrīdevi</i> in this in <i>śaran navarātra mahotsava</i>, and to take home a branch of it and worship it. Here the worship is not for the external form, but to <i>Śrīdevi</i> who is the presiding deity, and to the Almighty. If this <i>tattva</i> is kept in mind, there will be no room for any redicule.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_389">Question 11: We have seen earlier that people worship <i>Śamī Vṛksha</i> on <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>, and take a twig and some soil from the bottom of the tree to their houses. This practice is very significant among <i>kshatrīyas</i> who subsist on weapons. What are the great qualities of this <i>vṛksha</i> that make it exceptionally worshipful in the festival of <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_390">Answer: This also is a tree like <i>bilva</i> which is a form of the <i>Mahāvibhūti</i> of God. This tree is highly commended for <i>yajnas</i>. It is a tree which has <i>Agni</i> inside. The <i>samskṛita</i> equivalent for the word <i>Banni</i> in Kannada, is the word <i>&#x2018;Vahni</i>&#x2018; itself. <i>Maharshis</i> used to churn the sticks of this tree to produce sacred fire, from which they were performing <i>Yajnas</i>. For this reason this tree has come to be called <i>&#x201c;Agnigarbha&#x201d;</i></p>

				<p id="id_002_016_404"><i>Śrī Śamī Vṛksha</i> is a tree which is the abode of the fiery effulgence of <i>Durgā Devī</i> the <i>Śaktisvarūpiṇi</i>.

				<p id="id_002_016_405">The <i>pānḍavās</i> had deposited all their divine weapons in a <i>Śamīvṛksha</i>. just before they entered <i>ajnātavāsa</i> (living incognito). This great tree, i.e. the <i>Śamīvṛksha</i> earned the gratitude of the <i>pānḍavas</i> by returning the deposit in time, ably safeguarding it by its <i>Āgneyadurgā Śakti</i>. We read in the <i>purāṇas</i> that <i>ŚrīRāma</i> also, just before launching his campaign against <i>Rāvaṇa</i> offered salutations to <i>Devī</i> who was in the form of this <i>Śrīvṛksha</i>, and, feeling pleased by her words of <i>abhaya</i>, proceeded for the journey of conquest. At the time of <i>Śamīpūjā</i> the very remembrance of those great souls who, remained loyal to <i>Dharma</i> and obtained victory, bestows upon us an exceptional <i>Dharmanishṭhā</i>, on entering our mind, and provides inspiration for the accomplishment of victory. <i>Agni</i> is known as <i>pāvaka</i> i.e. the remover of sins. Likewise, this <i>Agnivṛksha</i> also is a redeemer of sins. It ousts the evil impressions opposed to <i>dharma</i> (dwelling in us) and creates an enthusiasm towards <i>Dharma</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_406">The following <i>ślokas</i> of prayer recited at the time of <i>Śamīpūja</i> sums up the above purports.</p>

Therefore it is very approppriate for them to worship this <i>agnimayavṛksha</i> which bestows upon them all these, before they set out on the journey.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_412">From the <i>ādhibhautika</i> point of view, it is an antidote to a number of diseases and enhances lustre (in the body). From the <i>Ādhidaivika</i> angle, it is the abode of gods and brings in the grace of <i>Durgāgnidevatā</i>. Looking at it from the spiritual angle, it is a tree which is an abode of <i>paramātmāgni</i> that makes one to cross the hurdles to <i>yoga</i>, and the one that helps in attaining <i>Samādhi</i> through <i>Upāsana</i>. Overall, it is highly appropriate to worship this tree on <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_413">Question 12: It has been stated earlier that a tree by name <i>Aparājita</i> can be worshipped in lieu of <i>Śamī</i> tree, if the latter is not available. Does this tree also possess such worshipful qualities?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_414">Ans: Certainly yes. The great sages have not named just some tree as an alternative. This tree also being a <i>mahāvibhūti</i> of <i>Devi</i>, possesses the great qualities like the <i>Śamī</i> trees and is worshipful.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_415">It is also called by other names such as <i>Jayantī</i>, <i>Vijayā</i> and <i>Arśaparṇī</i>. It should be remembered that the first two names are the name of <i>Jaganmātā</i> also. Even <i>Aparājitā</i> is an other name of <i>Durgādevī</i>. The <i>Devīpurāṇa</i> says that as <i>Śrī Devī</i> defeated the invincible demon king by name <i>Padma</i> and remained unconquerable by anyone, she is called <i>Vijayā</i> and <i>Aparājitā</i>.</p>

					﻿विजया तेन सा देवी लोके चैवापराजिता ॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_420">Thus, in addition to having the name of <i>Devī</i>, this <i>Aparājitā</i> tree remains an abode of exceptional presence of <i>Devī</i>, and so is suggested as a representative of <i>Śamī</i>. Some say it is just another genre of <i>Śamī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_421">From the Ayurvedic point of view, it is a medicine for <i>pitta</i> hassles and toxins. It also helps in getting over <i>tridoshas</i>. It is an eye coolant.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_422">When viewed from the <i>Ādhidaivika</i> angle, <i>Aparājitā</i> is (indeed) the abode of <i>Durgā Devī</i>. By worshipping her, one can achieve <i>ātmavijaya</i> and <i>lokavijaya</i>, says the <i>Skāndapurāṇa</i>.</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_423">
					﻿दशम्यां च नरैः सम्यक् पूजनीयाऽपराजिता ।<br />
					﻿मोक्षार्थं विजयार्थं च पूर्वोक्तविधिना नरैः ॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_427">Thus, the worship of the trees <i>Bilva, Śamī</i> and <i>Aparājitā</i> prescribed in the <i>Navarātra</i> and <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> festivals is not at all the worship of any inert nature.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_428">Thus, one can understand by discernment that this is indeed a variety of worship of that <i>Paramachaitanyarūpī Paramapurusha</i> who presides over <i>Prakṛti</i>, and of <i>Jaganmātā</i> who commands the inert nature.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_429">Question 13: <i>Vishṇu, Śiva</i> and <i>Durgā Devī</i> take to sleep in <i>Ashāḍha</i>. We come across precepts which state that the <i>Lokamātā</i> should be woken up during <i>Navarātra mahotsava</i> and worshipped.. What is the significance of this? Do these divinities really sleep.? If that is the case, who looks after the huge establishment of running the world?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_430">Ans: Actually speaking Gods and goddesses do not have even an iota of inertia of sleep. They are ever watchful, and keep overseeing the five duties such as <i>Śrīshṭi, Sthiti, Laya, Anugraha</i> and <i>Tirodhāna</i>. They always keep awake.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_431">Question 14: If so, why do the <i>śāstras</i> mention the states of wakefulness and sleep pertaining to them?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_432">Ans: It is just an offer of the <i>upacāras</i>. The service of sleep should be offered to them on a particular day in the <i>Ashāḍhamāsa</i> as a part of <i>Cāturmāsyapūjā</i>. It is not at all the wordly sleep. It is the <i>yoganidrā</i> that is full of (divine knowledge) <i>jnāna</i> and (divine bliss) <i>ānanda</i>. One has to have the <i>darśan</i> of the sleeping pose of the enchanting divine forms (of those gods and godesses). During the four months of <i>cāturmāsya</i> all of us have to reduce the quantum of wordly activities and should engage ourselves in <i>Dhyāna</i> and <i>pūja</i> at the place of our stay. And then, on the stipulated day in <i>Śaratkāla</i> we should offer the service of <i>suprabhātamaṅgala</i> and then start our routine with enthusiasm. This aspect has been dealt with in detail in the chapter of <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_433">Question 15: When should we offer the <i>upacāras</i> of sleep and awakening to <i>Śrīdurgādevī</i>, among the prominent gods and goddess mentioned above?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_434">Ans: The <i>nidropacāra</i> should be offered to <i>Śrī Durga Devī</i> on <i>Ashāḍha śukla Ashṭami</i> and the <i>suprabhātamaṅgala</i> should be offered in the <i>Śarannavarātra</i> festival in the <i>śuklapaksha</i> of <i>Āśvayujamāsa</i>. Sometimes, it is during the last part of the previous <i>Kṛshṇa Paksha</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_435">Question 16: What do the <i>śāstrās</i> state in this regard?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_436">Ans: If the eighteen armed form of <i>ŚrīDurga</i> is to be worshipepd, then the <i>suprabhātamaṅgala sevā</i> should be offered on the <i>Bhādrapada Kṅshṇanavamī</i>. If the ten armed <i>Devi</i> is to be worshipped, then it should be done on <i>Āśvayuja Śhuklashashṭhī</i> (During <i>Śarannavarātra</i>)</p>

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_442">Some say that the ten armed <i>Devī</i> should be offered <i>Suprabhātamaṅgala</i> on <i>Bhādrapada Kṛshṇanavamī</i> or <i>Āśhvayujaśukla shashṭī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_443">We feel the first opinion is right. Because, the <i>śāstras</i> have clearly prescribed different days of worship corresponding to the different forms of <i>Devī</i>. The <i>Kāḷikapurāṇa</i> has seperately injoined <i>Bhādrapadakṛshaṇavamī</i> for the <i>Āshṭādashabhujamūrtī</i> and <i>Āśvāyujaśuklaprathamā</i> for the <i>daśabhujamūrtī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_444">Question 17: At what time of the day the <i>pūja</i> of <i>Devī</i> should be done during <i>Navarātra</i> celebrations?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_445">Ans: It should be done three times a day—in the morning, noon and at night. The <i>pūja</i> at night is given greater importance.</p>

				<p id="id_002_016_451">Question 18: Which is more important for the <i>Navarātramahotsava</i>? The <i>pūjā—tithi</i> or <i>Nakshatra</i>?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_452">Ans: If both the specified <i>tithi</i> and <i>nakshatra</i> coincide, it is greatly auspicious. When they do not coincide, <i>tithi</i> itself should be taken as more important. The very names of the <i>utsavas</i> i.e. <i>Durgāshṭamī, Mahānavamī</i> and <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> which are in vogue, are associated with <i>tithis</i> only. The specified <i>tithi</i> and <i>nakshatras</i> for them are as follows:</p>

				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_471">Question 19: Precisely on which <i>tithi</i> should <i>Navarātri mahotsava</i> be begun?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_472">Ans: It is on <i>Āshvayuja śuddha prathamā</i>. But if <i>prathamā tithi</i> has <i>amāvāsyā</i> or <i>dvitīyā</i> touching it, we have to deliberate on when it should be begun. If <i>prathamā</i> is mixed with <i>amāvāsyā</i>, and if the following day does not have <i>prathamā</i>, then <i>Navarātra mahotsava</i> should begin on <i>prathamā</i> itself. If <i>prathamā</i> happens to prevail at sunrise and extends to less than three <i>muhūrtas</i> the next day, then the celebration should begin on the <i>pūrna prathamā</i> day only. &#x201c;If <i>amāvāsyā</i> continues for a period of one <i>muhūrta</i> (on the following day of <i>amāvasyā</i>) and <i>prathamā</i> that sets in after that happens to continue for less than three <i>muhūrtās</i> of time the next day, then, from the next day i.e.from the day of <i>Prathamā</i> which is mixed with <i>dvitīyā, Navarātra</i> festival should begin&#x201d; - This is the discernment tought by some <i>Kālamīmāmsakas</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_473">The <i>Devipurāṇa</i> says &#x201c;If there is <i>Vedha</i> of <i>Amāvāsyā</i> on <i>Prathamā</i>, it should be given up. And if <i>Prathamā</i> persists for even one <i>muhūrta</i> the next day (i.e. on <i>dvitīyā</i>), <i>Navarātra mahotsava</i> should begin on that day (i.e.on <i>dvitīyā</i>) only&#x201d;</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_474">
					﻿अमायुक्ता न कर्तव्या प्रतिपत्पूजने मम।<br />
					﻿मुहूर्तमात्रा कर्तव्या द्वितीयादि गुणान्विता॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_478">Contrary to this advice, we come across statements such as &#x201c;If one begins <i>Navarātra</i> on <i>Prathamā</i> mixed with <i>dvitīyā</i> either because of the passion for <i>devipūjā</i> in <i>Navarātra</i> or by the advice of someone, then he would lose his son&#x201d;</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_479">
					﻿द्वितीयाशेषसंयुक्ता प्रतिपच्चण्डिकार्चने।<br />
					﻿मोहादथोपदेशाद्वा कृतं पुत्रविनाशकम् ॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_483">No doubt, these contradictory statements do create a confusion. Some say <i>Devī</i> would not agree to her begining <i>pūjā</i> on <i>Prathamā</i> with <i>amāvāsyā Vedha</i>. &#x201c;If it is done on <i>prathamā</i> with <i>dvitīyā</i> touching it, one would lose his son,&#x201d; say some others. Actually speaking there is no contradiction in these two statements. The purport is, householders who desire fortunes such as sons, grandsons etc. should begin <i>Navarātrapūjā</i> on the day when <i>prathamā</i> prevails for a long time, even if it has the <i>vedha</i> of <i>Amāvāsyā. Virkatas</i> i.e. those who desire <i>Moksha</i> only, should not begin the <i>pūjā</i> on <i>Prathamā</i>, which has <i>vedha</i> of <i>amāvāsyā</i>.</p> 
				<p id="id_002_016_484">They should begin the <i>pūjā</i> on the second day even if <i>prathamā</i> prevails for a very short time and <i>dvitīyā</i> is for a long time. That means, those who have a desire for <i>dharmārthakāmas</i> should not begin if there is <i>vedha</i> of <i>dvitiyā</i>. Those who desire <i>moksha</i> only should avoid <i>amāvāsyā</i>. This is the purport.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_485">If it is a pure <i>Prathamā tithi</i> without any <i>Vedha</i>, then there is no scope for <i>vikalpa</i> at all.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_486">Question 20: What direction do the <i>śāstras</i> give about the time for the celebration of <i>vijayadaśamī</i>?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_487">The <i>daśamī</i> of <i>Āshvayuja śukla</i> is called <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> or <i>Vijayādaśamī</i>. <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> should be celebrated on that day.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_488">Question 21: Should the <i>daśamī</i> at sunrise be considered for this or at sunset?</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_489">And: If it is <i>śuklapaksha</i>, the <i>daśamī</i> at sunrise is to be considered. If it is <i>kṛshṇapaksha</i> it is <i>daśamī</i> at sunset.</p>
				<p class="shloka" id="id_002_016_490">
					﻿शुक्लपक्षे तिथिर्ग्राह्या यस्यामभ्युदितो रविः।<br />
					﻿कृष्णपक्षे तिथिर्ग्राह्या यस्यामस्तमितो रविः॥
				</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_494">According to this rule, as it is <i>śuklapaksha</i>, the <i>tithi</i> at sunrise also should be considered for <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>, some say. But as the situation here unlike the other <i>māsas</i> and <i>pakshas</i>, is one which relates to <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>, it is not possible to arrive at a conclusion by merely aplying the above said rule.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_495">Like the <i>daśamī tithi, Śravaṇnakshatra</i> is also excellent for <i>devatāpūjā</i> on that day. If both happen to occur, it is best and there can be no doubt about it. Here, like <i>Janmāshṭamī, tithi</i> is more important than <i>nakshatra</i>, but still <i>nakshatra</i> is also considered at times.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_496">A <i>Śāstramīmāmsaka</i> by name <i>Hemādri</i> says—<i>&#x201c;Vijayadaśamī</i> should be observed on the day of <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i>, if there is any <i>Vedha</i> on the day of <i>daśamī</i>; otherwise, it should be observed on the day of <i>navamī tithi&#x201d;</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_497">Some more opinions are as follows:</p>
				<ol id="id_002_016_498">
					<li id="id_002_016_499">If <i>daśamī</i> is touched by both <i>navamī</i> and  <i>Ekādaśī</i>, and, if there is no <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i> on the next day, then <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> should be observed on the day of <i>Navamī tithi</i> only.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_500"><i>Aparājitā Devī</i> should be worshipped only on the day when <i>daśamī</i> is touched by <i>navamī</i> in the afternoon.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_501"><i>Aparājitā devī</i> should never be worshipped on <i>Ekādaśī</i>.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_502">Afternoon is the most auspicious time for <i>Devī pūjā</i>. <i>Pradoshakāla</i> is the secondary option. If <i>daśamī</i> prevails in the afternoon on both the days, then the previous day itself (with <i>navamī</i>) should be considered for <i>Vijayadaśamī pūja</i>. If <i>daśamī</i> prevails during the time of <i>pradosha</i> both the days (but not in the afternoon), then the second day, (i.e. the day of <i>Ekādaśī</i>) should be considered for <i>Vijayadaśamī pūjā</i>. If <i>daśamī</i> does not prevail in the afternoon on both the days, then the first day (i.e. the day with <i>navamī</i>) should be considered for <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>. But if <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i> prevails in the afternoon of the next day, then that day (i.e. <i>daśamī</i> with <i>Ekādaśī</i>) should be considered for <i>vijayadaśamī pūjā</i>.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_503">If on a day <i>daśamī</i> prevails at least for a short time at sunrise, and the rest of the day is <i>Ekādaśī</i>, and <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i> prevails in the afternoon, then that day should be called <i>&#x2018;Vijayā&#x2019;</i>. Since <i>ŚrīRāma</i> launched his journey of conquest against <i>Rāvaṇa</i> on the day of <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i>, <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> should be celebrated on the day of that <i>nakshatra</i> only.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_504">The time of the rising of stars just after dusk on <i>Aśvayuja śukladaśamī</i> is called <i>&#x2018;vijaya&#x2019;</i>. Endeavours begun at that time shall become fruitful.</li>
					<li id="id_002_016_505">If fifteen <i>muhūrtas</i> happen to occur on any day, then the eleventh <i>muhūrta</i> is called <i>&#x2018;vijaya&#x2019;</i>.</li>
				</ol>
				<p id="id_002_016_507">When such a <i>muhūrta</i> occurs on a day, such an auspicious <i>daśamī</i> is called <i>Vijayadaśamī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_508">If pure <i>daśamī tithi</i> occurs without the touch of any other <i>tithi</i>, then <i>Vijayadaśamī</i> should be observed on that day without any <i>vikalpa</i>. If <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i> also occurs on that day, it is more auspicious. If the day happens to be a pure <i>daśamī &#x2018;tithi</i>, then even in the absence of <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra</i>, <i>Vijaya daśamī</i> should be observed on that day.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_509">When pure <i>daśami tithi</i> is not available then <i>dasāmi tithi</i> joined with <i>navamī</i> is prefrable to <i>Ekādaśī</i>. But if that <i>Ekādaśī</i> has the <i>Śravaṇa nakshatra yoga</i>, we think it is auspicious for <i>viajayadaśamī pūjā</i>, even if happens to be an <i>Ekādaśī</i>.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_510"><strong>Here, we would like to humbly interpret this matter on the strength of the impressions provided by <i>Śrīgurūpadesa</i> as follows:</strong> &#x201c;For those who desire <i>Dharma, Artha</i> and <i>Kama</i>, <i>daśamī</i> touched with <i>Navamī</i> is best, if pure <i>daśamī</i> is not available. For those who desire <i>Moksha</i>, <i>daśamī</i> touched with <i>Ekādaśī</i> is best, and for those who desire all the <i>Purushārthās, Ekādaśī</i> with <i>Śrāvaṇa</i> is best&#x201d;.</p>
				<p id="id_002_016_511">The abovesaid <i>Kālamīmāmsa</i> may sound unnecessary to the lay man. But when some doubts arise in that regard, it becomes very necessary to provide a satisfactory and critical clarification to the <i>jijnāsus</i>. Therefore, we have discussed the matter briefly here.</p>
