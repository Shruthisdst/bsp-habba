			<div class="HabbaTitle" id="id_002_017_001">Prathamaikādaśī</div>
			<p id="id_002_017_002"><i>Prathamaikādaśī</i> is one of the most important festivals observed in our country. The <i>Ekādaśī</i> which falls in the <i>śuklapaksha</i> of the month of <i>Āshāḍha</i> is called by this name. This festival is also called by names such as <i>Ekādaśī</i>, festival of fasting, <i>mahaikādasī</i>, <i>sāyanī</i> etc. This happens to be a very important <i>parva</i> observed by virtuous people of all the <i>varṇas</i> and <i>Āśramas</i>, and people belonging to all sects such as <i>Śaiva</i>, <i>Vaishṇava</i> etc.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_003"><strong>1) Nāmanirvacana</strong> (explanation of the name): This is called <i>Ekādaśī</i> as this is a <i>vrata</i> related to the <i>Ekādaśi tithi. Ekādaśī</i> comes twice every month. But this <i>Ekādaśī</i> is the most important of all <i>Ekādaśīs</i>, and so is called by that name. There is a rule that those who cannot afford to observe the other <i>Ekādaśīs</i> in the prescribed manner, should observe at least this <i>Ekādaśī.</i> Thus, this is specially called <i>Ekādaśī</i>. For example, all the <i>caturdaśis</i> of the <i>Kṛshṇapaksha</i> of every month are <i>Śivarātris</i> only. But only the <i>caturdaśi</i> of the <i>Kṛshṇapaksha</i> of the <i>Māghamāsa</i> is called <i>Śivarātri.</i> Just as <i>Śivarātri</i> is so called because of the special importance it carries on that day, the above said <i>Ekādaśī</i> of the <i>śuklapaksha</i> of <i>Āshāḍha</i> is called <i>Ekādaśī</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_004"><i>Prathamaikādaśī</i> means the first <i>Ekādaśī</i>. When the <i>Ekādaśīs</i> of the <i>śuklapaksha</i> of all the months are <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>s, how come only this is called <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>? It is because,</p>
			<ol id="id_002_017_005">
				<li id="id_002_017_006">There is a custom among some Hindus to begin the year with <i>varshaṛtu</i> (rainy season). (The synonym <i>varsha</i> for <i>samvatsara</i> indicates this.) As per that reckoning, this <i>Ekādaśī</i> occurs at the beginning of the year, and so the name <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>.</li>
				<li id="id_002_017_007">As this <i>Ekādaśī</i> immediately precedes the beginning of <i>&#x2018;cāturmāsya&#x2019;</i> which happens to be an important <i>vrata</i>, this is referred to as <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>.</li>
				<li id="id_002_017_008">The word <i>&#x2018;prathama&#x2019;</i> is also used to mean &#x2018;the very best&#x2019;, (scholars have noted that the word <i>&#x2018;prathama&#x2019;</i>, used by <i>Kālidāsa</i> in his <i>meghasandeśa</i> also means &#x2018;the best&#x2019;, in the verse <i>&#x2018;Āshāḍhasya prathama divase.&#x2019;</i> If the meaning for the word <i>Prathama</i> here is taken in the sense of <i>&#x2018;First&#x2019;</i>, the <i>Utthānadvādaśi</i> referred to in stanza 47 falls short by 20 days). Also, as this happens to be the most auspicious among the <i>Ekādaśīs</i>, this is duly called <i>Prathamaikādaśī</i>. The other name <i>Mahaikādasi</i> also signifies the greatness of this <i>vrata</i>. Though this comes in the <i>dakshiṇayāna,</i> it is called <i>sāyanī</i> also because it bestows the path of <i>Devayāna</i> called <i>uttarāyaṇa</i>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p id="id_002_017_010">As this this is a great festival during which the rules of fasting have to be (specially) observed, it is referred to as &#x2018;a festival of fasting&#x2019;. In this sense, even the <i>MahāŚivarātri</i> is a festival of fasting only.</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_011">2. Statements of scriptures which prescribe fasting:</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_012">We come across hundreds of statements in <i>smṛtis</i>, <i>purāṇas</i>, history, and <i>parva mīmāmsā</i> literature, which ordain fasting on this day. Some of them may be noted here.</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_013">1). The <i>purāṇas</i> proclaim time and again&#x2014;&#x201c;On the day of <i>Harivāsara</i> (i.e. <i>Ekādaśī</i>), all the sins take refuge in food. So, a person taking food on that day, becomes a party for those sins. So, never take food on a <i>Harivāsara&#x201d;</i></p>

			<p id="id_002_017_073">The significance of fasting on <i>Ekādaśī</i> has been greatly described by the <i>śāstras</i>. A few of them may be noted here.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_074">The <i>Padmapurāṇa</i> says &#x2014;</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_075">As a result of fasting on <i>Ekādaśī</i>, the firewood of sins accumulated over hundreds of births gets burnt to ashes. Even the benefit accrued by performing <i>mahāyāgas</i> does not amount to even the one sixteenth part of the religious merit gained by fasting on <i>Ekādaśī</i>. Even great pilgrimage centers cannot equal this. This bestows great worldly benefits such as heaven, <i>moksha</i>, kingdom, virtuous children, good wife, good health etc.</p>

			<p id="id_002_017_093">The moment the word <i>Ekādaśī</i> falls on their ears, even <i>yamadūtas</i> become hesitant.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_094">&#x201c;श्रुत्वा चैकादशी नाम यमदूताश्च शङ्क,इताः  (<i>Padmapurāṇa</i>, <i>Brahmakhanda</i>). &#x201c;A certain woman, who was a worst sinner, happened to fast in <i>Ekādaśī</i> due to some anger and died. Even she became purified.&#x201d;</p>

			<p id="id_002_017_104"><i>Prathamaikādaśī</i> is also well&#x2014;known by the name <i>śayanaikādaśi</i> in the <i>śāstras</i>. In some texts we come across words such as &#x2018;शयनी बोधिनी मध्ये या ﻿कृष्णैकादशी भवेत् सायनैकादशी” It is indeed hard to reason how the word <i>śayana</i> has come to get associated with <i>Ekādaśī</i> here. It is possible that, the word <i>śāyana</i>, either by mispronunciation or due to a printing error, has become <i>&#x2018;sāyana&#x2019;</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_105">1) Why then, this is called by the name <i>śayanaikādaśi</i>? <i>Śayana</i> means going to bed or sleeping. It is not the <i>Sādhakas</i> who are supposed to sleep on this day. <i>Jnānis</i> say that <i>Sādhakas</i> should keep themselves awake during the whole day and also during the night (if possible), and meditate upon God and praise his glory.</p>

			<p id="id_002_017_110">In that case which sleep is intended by the word <i>śayana</i> here? The scriptures say that it refers to the sleep of the great Lord, <i>MahāVishṇu,</i> who is specially worshipped in this <i>parva</i>. He sleeps on the day of <i>Āshadhaśukladvādaśi</i> and wakes up on <i>Kartikaśukla dvādaśi</i>. In the meantime he may also turn over on his side, in the month of <i>bhādrapadamāsa</i>.</p>

			<p id="id_002_017_173"><i>Dayāndasarasvati</i> ridicules the idea of stipulating different <i>Ekādaśī</i> days for <i>Smārtas</i> and <i>Vaishṇavas</i>. &#x201c;The division of <i>Smārtas</i>, <i>Vaishṇavas</i> and <i>ŚrīVaishṇavas</i> is of recent origin. How can this figure in the opinion of sages who wrote <i>śāstras</i>? he says. Also, we come across many a handiwork, such as creating new stories to condemn the opinion of others and to defend one&#x2019;s own, composing new sentences and inserting them in the text of the <i>śāstras</i> written in old palm leaves etc. And so, it becomes difficult to identify interpolations and the genuine text parts as well.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_174">As per the prevalent practice, <i>Ekādaśī</i> is observed by those who are calld <i>Smārtas,</i> on the day when the <i>Ekādaśī tithi</i> has more pervasion, inspite of the <i>vedha</i> of <i>Daśami</i>. <i>Vaishṇavas</i> and <i>ŚrīVaishṇavas</i> do not observe <i>Ekādaśī vrata</i> on the day when it has the <i>vedha</i> of <i>Daśami</i>. One may try to provide a solution by saying that it is proper if people of different categories follow their respective traditions. Even some <i>Ācāryas</i> who have proclaimed that fasting on <i>Ekādaśī</i> should be observed on the day which is free from <i>vedha</i> have said &#x201c;Let them observe fasting at least on the day with <i>vedha</i>. It will anyhow please Lord <i>Śrīhari&#x201d;</i>. (<i>haridina tilakam</i> of <i>Ācārya venkatanātha</i>).</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_175">&#x201c;But, why is that contradicting opinions in the ancient <i>śāstras</i> are seen regarding the observance of <i>Ekādaśī</i> which is distinguished (by the division such as) the one with <i>vedha</i> of <i>Daśami</i> and the other without? What has the present classification viz <i>smārtas, Vaishṇavas</i> and <i>ŚrīVaishṇavas</i> got to do with the above said śāstraic words? This question remains to be solved. Even the <i>&#x2018;Kāzinyāya</i> (A kannada word which means &#x201c;a verdict which is meant to satisfy both the parties in a dispute.&#x201d; <i>Śāstraic</i> words?) cannot be applied here. Then which of the two traditions is right? <strong>We placed this question before <i>ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru</i> who was endowed with the capacity of measuring the effect of the observance of that <i>vrata</i> on the human body and soul with the help of the relevant scientific knowledge, and who was able to comprehend the benefits obtained by observing the <i>vrata</i> on both the days, and also what one may lose by abstaining from that observance, and also the different kinds of beneficial effects. He could comprehend these with practical knowledge, and not by mere bookish knowledge.</strong></p>
			<p id="id_002_017_176"><strong>&#x201c;Both the traditions are correct&#x201d; came the answer. &#x201c;How could both be correct?&#x201d; &#x201c;Is it not ridiculous to have different arrangements for <i>Smārtas, Vaishṇavas, ŚrīVaishṇavas</i> Etc?&#x201d; was our next question. He commanded—&#x201c;I did not mean that kind of an arrangement. There are two types of people who observe fast; The ones who belong to the first type desire only <i>moksha</i>. The people of the second type desire in addition of <i>moksha</i>, the other accomplishments of life viz. <i>Dharma, Artha</i> and <i>Kāma</i>. The <i>tithi</i> without <i>Daśami vedha</i> is suitable for the people of the first type, and the <i>tithi</i> with <i>Daśami vedha</i> is suitable for the second type.&#x201d;</strong></p>

			<p id="id_002_017_300">Thus, done with a vow, the observation comes to be called <i>&#x2018;Ekādaśī Vrata&#x2019;</i> (<i>Ekādaśī vrata</i> can also be done without the <i>saṅkalpa</i> by following the remaining rules.) There is will be no <i>homa</i> in this <i>vrata</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_301">The next morning, after the worship of God and feeding the Brāhmins, the <i>vrata</i> should be completed. This completion of observance is also called <i>&#x2018;pāraṇa&#x2019;</i>. It is so called because, the <i>vrata</i> can see the <i>pāra</i> (the other end) only by that (पार तीर कर्म समाप्तौ).</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_302">The completion will be only on <i>Dvādaśi</i>. And till this <i>vrata</i> is completed no other <i>vrata</i> should be taken up.</p>

			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_307">Full benefit of the <i>vrata</i> will be obtained only with the worship of Brahmins and their blessings.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_308">The <i>kūrmapurāṇa</i> says that <i>Pāraṇa</i> should be observed only on <i>dvādaśi</i> and not on <i>Trayodaśi</i>. But if no trace of <i>dvādaśi</i> is there on the day next to the day of fasting, then <i>pāraṇa</i> will have to be done on <i>Trayodaśi</i> itself. Even the <i>Mādhyahnika</i> should be done in the morning itself on the day of <i>Dvādaśī</i>, and <i>Pāraṇa</i> lunch should be had. It is <i>Ekabhukta</i> only even on <i>Dvādaśi</i> and dinner should not be had. Sleeping during day time etc is prohibited.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_309">The three some viz. <i>Daśami, Ekādaśī</i> and <i>Dvādasi</i>, is called <i>&#x2018;haridina&#x2019;</i>. Even those who cannot observe <i>Ekādaśī</i>, should worship god during the dawn of <i>dvādaśī</i>, and should do <i>pāraṇa</i> in the morning. It is because, just like <i>Ekādaśī, Dvādaśī</i> also is independently an excellent day to propitiate God and a <i>vratadina</i>. If it is not possible to do <i>pāraṇa</i> on time, at least <i>jalapāraṇa</i> (i.e. drinking of water) should be done. Thus, drinking of water in the prescribed manner will bestow the benefits of both <i>Bhojana</i> and <i>Upavāsa.</i></p>

			<h3 id="id_002_017_313">(1) Pūja and Jāgaraṇa</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_314">The three <i>puṇyakāryas</i> (meritorious deeds) that have to be mainly performed on the day of <i>Ekādaśī</i> as per the śāstraic customs are—</p>
			<ol id="id_002_017_315">
				<li id="id_002_017_316">day and night fasting</li>
				<li id="id_002_017_317"><i>Jāgaraṇa</i> and</li>
				<li id="id_002_017_318">worship of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_320">
				एकादश्यामहोरात्रं कर्तव्यं भो जन त्रयम् । <br />
				﻿दिवारात्रोपवासश्च जागरो विष्णुपूजनम् ॥
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_324">The last one of the above i.e. the worship of god (both internal and external) should be specially done. Every person should do this to the best of his capacity. Among the three <i>tithis</i> viz., <i>Daśami</i>, <i>Ekādaśī</i> and <i>Dvādaśi</i> known as <i>Haridinas</i>, the middle one i.e. <i>Ekādaśī</i> is excellent for the worship of <i>Nārāyaṇa</i>. The inner spiritual centers related to Lord <i>Vishṇu</i> blossom naturally on that day. Just as a favourable wind helps a traveller, mother nature helps a <i>Sādhaka</i> to advance in the inward spiritual path. <i>&#x2018;Gāḷi Bandāga Tūriko&#x2019;</i>, (Rush your way when the wind blows favourably) is a proverb in <i>Kannada</i>. On this analogy, one should utilize the facility provided by nature and worship god in a special way and should obtain the desired accomplishments. This indeed is the intention of the <i>Jnānis</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_325">And now about <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> during the night. Generally people work during the day and spend the night in sleep. No doubt sleep is very good for health. But <i>śāstras</i> prescribe that the night hours of <i>Ekādaśī</i> should not be squandered in sluggish sleep, and restraint should be exercised. And <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> should be observed as long as possible even on that night, for the purpose of remaining in the divine <i>Bhāva</i> which facilitates a slothless sleep, ie.<i> Brahmasamādhi</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_326">This observance of <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> is prescribed only to worship God with full devotion which is said to be nine fold viz. <i>Śrāvaṇa</i>, <i>Kīrtana</i>, <i>smaraṇa</i>, <i>Pādapūja</i>, <i>Arcana</i>, <i>Vandana</i>, <i>Dāsya, Sakhya</i> and <i>Ātmanīvedana</i>. And it should be noted that <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> (keeping oneself awake) is not an end in itself. During <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> one is supposed to be engaged in activities which nourish a divine <i>Bhāva</i>. But some people, under the wrong impression that <i>puṇya</i> is obtained anyway by merely keeping themselves awake during that time, engage themselves in either sports/entertainments or quarrel mongering. This is unscriptural and even amounts to <i>Adharma</i>. By this, the desired auspicious attainment is lost and the accrual of the unwished shall follow. Those who cannot afford a total fast, should keep awake as long as possible and should achieve <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> spiritually. If for any reason/s <i>Jāgaraṇa</i> happens to cause impairment either to one&#x2019;s health or meditation, it is better to resort to sleep.</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_327">ii) Discussion on fasting&#x2014;</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_328"><strong>(1) Literal meaning: &#x2014;</strong> Generally fasting means abstaining from food and drinks. Scriptures explain that abstaining from food and drinks externally, happens to be one of the external features connected with fasting.</p> 
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_329">
				&#x201c;यज्ञेन तपसा अनाशकेन <span class="gap">(बृ. उ. IV-4-22)</span> <br />
				﻿एकादश्यां न भुञ्जीत पक्षयोरुभयोरपि&#x201d; <span class="gap">﻿(कात्यायन)</span> 
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_333">This <i>vrata</i> is also known by the names <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i>, <i>&#x2018;upavāsanam&#x2019; &#x2018;aupvastam&#x2019;. &#x2018;Uposhitam&#x2019;</i> and <i>&#x2018;uposhanam&#x2019;</i>. As there are several meanings for verb roots, the meaning viz. abstaining from food has come to stay, says the <i>amarasudhākara</i> &#x201c;अनेकार्थत्वादभोजने वृत्तिः&#x201d;  भोजनविरहस्य&#x201d;,  Though these meanings are in usage, some more important aspects come to light when their <i>avayavārthas</i> are examined. The words <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i>, <i>&#x2018;upavasana&#x2019;</i> mean living closer. (वस निवासे, उप समीपे वासः)</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_334">The word <i>Upavastā</i> means one who remains near and causes a stoppage. And that act of his is called <i>&#x2018;aupavasta&#x2019;.</i> ﻿(वस्तुस्तम्भे, उपवस्तुः कर्म औपवस्तम्)</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_335">The <i>avayavārtha</i> of <i>Uposhitam</i>, and <i>Uposhaṇam&#x2019;</i> is burning by remaining very close. (<i>usha&#x2014;dāhe</i>). When these meanings are taken in connection with the <i>vrataniyamas</i>, questions such as, closer to whom should one live? In whose company should one remain? What should be arrested? What should get burnt etc? arise. The answers that are obtained naturally to these questions are as follows: One should remain close to God; should possess <i>Ātmaguṇas,</i> should restrain the senses inactive, and should cause the bad deeds and the bad <i>samskāras</i> to get burnt down.</p>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_336">
				﻿उपावृत्तस्य पापेभ्यो यस्तु वासो गुणैस्सह । <br />
				﻿उपवासस्स विज्ञेयो न शरीरस्य शोषणम् ॥
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_340">(To cease from sinful activities and to be in the company of <i>Āthmaguṇas</i> itself is <i>upavāsa</i>. <i>Upavāsa</i> is not merely oppressing the body).</p>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_341">
				﻿कथाद्या गीतिका विष्णोर्गायन् विष्णुपरायणः ॥
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_344">(One should keep singing the praises and stories of <i>Śrīhari</i>, &#x201c;पापालस्यादि वर्जितम्&#x201d; (one should keep off from sinful acts and laziness etc.)—<i>Śāstravākyas</i> like these support this opinion.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_345">In that case why did the term <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i> come to mean &#x201c;giving up of food?&#x201d; It is because, when one keeps himself close to God, he remains in the <i>Paramātmasamādhi,</i> having burnt down both <i>puṇya</i> and <i>pāpa,</i> and has his senses inactive, he needs no food. The very sense organ ie the tongue, which tastes food and drinks, becomes powerless. The <i>Jnānendriyas</i> (viz. the sense organs which perceive sound, touch, form, taste and smell) get still. Thus in the real sense, it will be a state of total fast. And so, the fasting done externally symbolizing the <i>upavāsa</i> within, comes to be called <i>&#x2018;Upavāsa&#x2019;</i>. Also, the absence of food in the body, and the absence of digestion of food fecilitate meditation, and to remain close to God. This also has been a reason to make the word <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i> to aptly connote the sense of abstainment from taking food externally. Even the act of fasting that helps <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i>, is also <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i>.</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_346">(2) Why should one fast?</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_347">When a person goes on fast at regular intervals, the body becomes free from ailments. &#x2018;लङ्घनं परमौषधम्’ says the <i>āyurveda</i>. This is a fact established by experience also. But the fasting prescribed as a part of the ritual, does not just result in bestowing health alone. No doubt health is very essential for meditation. &#x201c;अनामयी यावदात्मानं सम्मन्यते&#x201d;.  But fasting helps <i>Dhyāna</i> in other ways also.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_348">When food is consumed, the digestive organs and the mind get engaged in digesting the food and preventing the wear and tear of the body and helping in it&#x2019;s upkeep. If they are ordered to stop their work and asked to function in a unidirectional disposition facilitating meditation, they may spite and deprecate. If forced to act they can hamper both <i>pravrtti</i> and <i>Nivṛtti</i> So, for a distinct period of time, they should be provided with rest from functions like digestion. Then they become capable of meditating on Good unidirectionally.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_349">Another excellent way is to provide both the senses and the mind the objects of their desire and making them totally focussed on God. For example, the work (and object of desire) of the tongue is talking, and hearing is the work of the ears. By directing them respectively to sing the glory of God and to listen to the stories of God and making them work accordingly, one is helped to lodge himself close to God. If the body remains light because of abstaining from food, it helps in the <i>&#x2018;upavāsa&#x2019;</i> in the form of service to God by the senses to God.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_350">P.V. Kāṇe, a well known critic says, &#x201c;The principle of fasting on <i>Ekādaśī</i> is spiritual in nature. It is a discipline of the mind. A fast observed willingly with enthusiasm and happiness removes the beastly feelings from the mind and makes it capable of receiving the grace of god.&#x201d; But he has not explained how it happens. But it is indeed commendable that he notes that fasting should be undertaken with enthusiasm.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_351">On the whole, it should be importantly remembered that fasting is a means like <i>jāgaraṇa</i> for the purpose of worship of God and <i>Yoga</i>, and not an end in itself.</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_352">In this very sense, <i>Mahātmas</i> have preached thus&#x2014;&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be a slave to fasting. Use it as your servant and make it a ladder to ascend to the divine <i>Bhāva</i>.&#x201d;</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_353">While praising the glory of <i>Śrīmadbhāgavatam,</i> the <i>Padmapurāṇa</i> says, &#x201c;If fasting becomes a hindrance to listen to the stories of God, it is not good. Comparably, the food that helps a person to listen to the glory of God, is commendable&#x201d;. This should be remembered in this context.</p> 
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_354">
				﻿भोजनं तु वरं मन्ये कथाश्रवणकारकम्
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_357">Some people deride &#x201c;It is ludicrous to advise Indians to fast. Because most of the people have to generally fast due to lack of food. It amounts to cruetly to advise them to remain hungry as they can get only a small quantity of food some how.&#x201d;—This is incorrect because if someone stays hungry due to lack of food, displeasure, ostentation etc., it can never be an <i>upavāsa</i> endorsed by the <i>śāstras</i>.</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_358">2) Who should not observe fast?</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_359">Those who feel weak mentally or those who happen to suffer from ill&#x2014;health due to fasting, should not observe fast at all. Scriptures clearly state that it amounts to sin, if children below the age of eight years, old people above eighty, patients whose life span gets reduced because of fasting, and pregnant women observe fast. And if people whose body conditions get disturbed due to fasting and consequently tend to think only of food instead of focussing on God, they will not benefit by fasting.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_360">The <i>śāstras</i> also say that going on fast for no reason amounts to an act of offence against God. Because, by that the share of <i>Havis</i> which should reach the deities such as <i>prāṇa</i> etc would be missed by them. And, on days when exhaustion is caused because of inevitable physical work, fasting should not be done. Also, fasting is not a must for those who are in some distinct paths of <i>Yoga</i>. By excessive fasting they may encounter hindrances in their <i>sādhana</i>. Fasting need not be forced on such people. It need not be enforced also on great souls who are <i>Brahmasiddhas</i> and who are always immersed in <i>Ātmasantosha</i> which happens to be the ultimate benefit of fasting. They have, in this regard, the right to act according to the dictates of their inner self.<strong> We humbly remember here the command of <i>Śrīraṅgamahāguru</i> who said—&#x201c;Instructions such as &#x201c;Take the medicine. Follow the diet. Don&#x2019;t consume curds&#x201d; etc., are meant for the sick. Healthy persons need not be bound by them. But even a healthy person may follow them to set a good example for the world.</strong>&#x201d; Also, we are reminded of the words of <i>Dharmaśāstra</i>s which say &#x201c;One should not come to a conclusion based merely as the words of <i>śāstras</i>. If the judgement happens to be devoid of reasoning, it results in <i>Dharmahāni</i> only</p>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_361">
				﻿केवलं शास्त्रमाश्रित्य न कर्तव्यो विनिर्णयः । <br />
				युक्तिहीने विचारे तु धर्महानिः प्रजायते”॥
			</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_365">3) What may be done by weak persons?</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_366">What should weak persons do on the day of observance of religious fasting? Those who cannot afford to fast for the whole day, may observe a partial fast. They may eat during the day and fast at night or vice versa. Both are approved by the <i>śāstras</i>. This option pertaining to the observance of the relevant <i>vrata</i> may be followed by a person depending upon his physical and mental dispositions.</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_367">Those who cannot observe complete fast may take light food. But the food thus taken should be <i>sāttvik</i> in nature. And even such a food should be taken in a small quantity, taking care to see that it will not impede the worship of God. <i>Śāstras</i> say that such persons can take water, milk, fruits, curds, ghee, bulbous roots, sweet potato or <i>havishyānna</i> etc. Uncooked food items may be taken in a limited quantity. The food thus taken should not cause intoxication but should make the body and mind feel light. We come across advices which suggest that direct rice preparations should not be taken but preparations made from modified rice (i.e. rice in the fried or broken form) can be consumed in a limited quantity. But, taking advantages of this concession, some people heavily consume many kinds of foods and <i>citrānnas</i> (spicy rice mixes), drink a variety of beverages, and yet feel they have observed <i>upavāsavrata</i>. An adage in kannada <i>&#x201c;Annakke mūru mānavādare appaccige āru māna&#x201d;</i> (It is three measures for rice but six for tiffins) is superbly proved by them! The <i>Phalāhāra vrata</i> of such people is indeed a <i>vrata</i> of <i>halavu Āhāra</i> (<i>kannada&#x2014;Many foods</i>). A skit goes like this: A person asks the other &#x2018;who is that, seated behind the heap of <i>uppittu?</i> (cooked broken wheat cereal). &#x201c;I am <i>Subbiah</i> here. Don&#x2019;t you know that I am observing <i>Ekādāśi vrata&#x201d;</i>? This counter question itself served as the answer. No wonder, satires such as:</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_368"><i>&#x201c;Āce mane subbammanorge Ekādaśi Upavāsa Ello svalpa tintārante Uppittu Avalakki pāyasa!&#x201d;</i> have come up.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_369">(A Kannada poem which means <i>Subbamma</i>, the neighbour is observing a fast on account of <i>Ekādaśī</i>. She eats something very little; cooked wheat cereal, flattened rice and <i>payasa</i>).</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_370">(This is the grandeur of just the breakfast on <i>Ekādaśī</i>!)</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_371">No need to explain that pompous <i>phalāhāras</i> like these are unscriptural. But, taking medicine and, following the words of a <i>Jnāni</i> (to take some food), do not amount to breaking of the vow of <i>Ekādaśī</i>)</p>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_372">
				﻿अष्टैतान्यव्रतघ्‌नानि आपोमूलं घृतं पयः । <br />
				﻿हविः ब्राह्मणकाम्या च गुरोर्वचनमौषधम् ॥
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_376">If one follows as per the advice of an <i>Acārya</i> who is a <i>Jnānavijnāna tṛptātma,</i> he shall obtain the grace of god. Medication leads to good health. As both of these happen to be the benefits and limbs of religious fasting, <i>śāstras</i> advise as said above.</p>
			<h3 id="id_002_017_377">1. Rules that are helpful in fasting</h3>
			<p id="id_002_017_378">Those who observe fast should also observe strict <i>brahmacarya</i>. Their minds, words and deeds should be pure. It is best to observe total silence on that day. We wish to quote an instance where a person happened to cause the spread of an unsavoury effect by indulging in loose talk, without caring to follow a rule of this <i>vrata</i> called <i>Mouna</i>. (silence)</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_379">A few boys were having meals on an <i>Ekādaśī</i>. An elderly person beaming with happiness resulting from a heavy <i>phalāhāra</i>, happened to come there. Enjoying both the sight and the smell of the meals which the boys were having, he quoted a line from the <i>Dharma śāstra</i> and chided. &#x201c;You are eating a meal on an <i>Ekādaśī</i> and it amounts to eating dog poop,&#x201d; and created a disgusting feeling both in the mind of the boys and in his own <i>prakṛti</i> (disposition).</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_380">We have come across some ignoble practices in some houses where fasting is observed, such as abstaining from taking the daily bath till evening on the day of <i>Ekādaśi</i> because of the fear of the very thought of food after bath, indulging in reading stories and novels which abound in wordly <i>bhāvas</i> instead of listening to the stories of God, and reproaching others etc. No need to emphasise that these have to be totally given up.</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_381"><i>Ekādaśī</i> is a highly sacred <i>Mahāparva</i>. One should worship Lord <i>Nārāyaṇa</i> both internally and externally on that day. We feel that acts like abstaining from food or limited intake of food as per the guidelines of the <i>śāstras</i> and observing <i>jāgaraṇa</i> which fecilitate such a worship, conform to the <i>śāstras</i>.</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_382">In the <i>Bhagavadgīta</i>, Lord <i>Kṛshṇa</i> says&#x2014;</p>
			<p class="shloka" id="id_002_017_383">
				﻿विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः । <br />
				﻿रसवर्जं रसोप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥
			</p>
			<p id="id_002_017_387">(A person, who observes <i>upavāsa</i> without providing food for his body, mind and the senses, gets freed from <i>śabda</i> (sensation of sound) and <i>sparśa</i> (sensation of touch) and other sensations; but <i>Rasa</i> (desire) for worldly pleasure does not leave him. When he visualizes God, even that desire leaves him).</p> 
			<p id="id_002_017_388">Therefore it is good to keep our sense organs away from the objects of their desire on <i>Ekādaśī,</i> and make them fast. And, rather than just stopping at that, if one meditates on god and visualises him, even the desire for the worldly pleasures dries up. Such a person refuge in god who is a <i>Paramānanda Rasasvarūpi</i> (An embodiment of the essence of highest bliss). For the sake of the achievement of such a <i>paramapurushārtha</i> (the greatest goal of life), fasting should be done on that day.</p>
