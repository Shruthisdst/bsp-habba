	<h1>Publisher's Preface</h1>
	<p>We offer our endless pranams (obeisances) at the holy lotus feet of <i>SriSriRangapriya Sri Srih,</i> the supreme Yogi, who was blessed by the grace of <i>Sri SriRangamahaguru.</i> H.H. the Swamiji was the president of <i>Bharata Darshana</i>, and is the author of this book.</p> 
	<p>By the grace of the kindly Lord, and the benevolent glance of the merciful Sadguru, and by the good wishes of the learned and good hearted persons, we are offering this book &#x201c;Yogic And Vedic Heritage - FESTIVALS OF BHARATA&#x201d; at the holy feet of God, and we are placing it as a sacred prasada in the hands of our dear readers.</p> 
	<p>Today, even though we celebrate many festivals that were graced to us by the enlightened persons (Jnanis), we are not observing them with the due knowledge of the spiritual science behind them. While some people are observing them with apathetic belief, some are observing them with half hearted trust, and also with indifference. Many people hit by hardships, poverty and want of time, observe the festivals with weariness, and curse the very arrival of these festivals and feasts. We are not being properly enlightened in this regard. At the same time, propagandists of Anarya Samskriti (unrefined culture), who are proliferating like the progeny of the demon &#x2018;Rakta beejasura&#x2019;, and armed with their practices, theories and activities, have been invading our culture and virtuous conducts. We have lost our discernment and also our pride, and so we are being subjected to scorn as a result of blind imitations. Let us explain this by an example:</p> 
	<p>The celebration of a birthday as per virtuous Bharatiya traditions include taking an oil bath and wearing of new clothes, lighting a lamp in front of God, offering obeisance to Teachers (Gurus) and elders, and seeking their blessings for health, prosperity, success, peace, contentment, good nourishment, and abundant growth, consuming prasada which consists of six different dishes, keeping away from either scolding others or getting abused by them, dwelling in auspicious thoughts, and drawing out a plan with family and friends happily for brightness and prosperity. But, due to the influence of the alien culture, a new custom (of celebrating birthdays) has made an entry in our country, even into the households of orthodox and tradition respecting people.</p> 
	<p>In this, cakes numbering the age of the person whose birthday is being celebrated are cut, and an equal number of lighted candles are put out. Nobody questions this. If at all anyone were to question this, the answer would be—&#x201c;The cake, and the drinks taken along are the flesh and blood of Jesus. The number of lamps put out stand for the number of years completed by the person so far, and it is a symbol of the vow—&#x2018;Let us lead a good life at least in future&#x2019;.—This is the new custom.</p>
	<p>It is a disgrace that followers of Sanatana Arya Bharateeya Samskruthi are into accepting this custom and its observance, like copy cats. Because, on a birthday, one is supposed to consume prasada (consecrated food) offered to God, and not the flesh and blood of a great soul who was crucified by inconsiderate people who lacked judgment. The auspicious thoughts on that day should be about long life, and making a sacred vow &#x2019;—<i>Tanme manasshivasankalpamastu&#x2019;</i>, and not the remembrance of the past days of bad <i>Vasanās</i> (impressions of good or bad actions)</p>
	<p>The act of putting out the light (in the candle) is a custom which is indeed most inauspicious and an unwished one. In the homes of the virtuous and tradition respecting people, no one would utter the words—&#x201c;Blow out the lamps&#x2019;. Instead one would only say—&#x201c;increase the light of the lamp&#x201d;. (In Hindi they say &#x2018;Deepak badhavo&#x2019; and not Deepak bazaavo&#x2019;) If the lamp is extinguished, light vanishes and darkness sets in. We generally pray God to lead us towards light from darkness—<i>&#x2018;Tamaso ma jyotirgamaya&#x2019;</i> and not <i>&#x2018;Jyotishah Tamo gamaya&#x2019;</i> (lead me towards darkness from light).</p>
	<p>In the above custom of the aliens, only the part of drawing out a good plan (for the year) is O.K. But the rest is all inauspicious. Why should Sanatana Arya Bharateeyas give up the custom of worshipping the auspicious deities and embrace the opposite of it?</p>
	<p>This scared book is an attempt to set right to the extent possible, these erors related to the festivals and feasts, which have crept in because of lack of wisdom, laziness and lack of pride. The essays (articles) here scientifically explain the division of festivals, their common true form, necessity, importance, analysis, the proper and improper forms, the time of celebration, the materials needed, the method of observance, the benefits, and other such important matters. The Bharateeya festivals are not modes of forms of any blind tradition. They have a sound scientific background. The articles here indeed convince the virtuous who are free from prejudice, that the festivals have the potential to bestow the four-fold values of life i.e. Dharma (virtuous conduct), Artha (prosperity), Kama (Desires or enjoyment not opposed to Dharma) and Moksha (Liberation-Emancipation).</p> 
	<p>In the description of these festivals, a discerning explanation of the deities that are worshipped on the respective days (of festivals) is given. Some may feel that the explanations are very elaborate. But, many people at many places are falling preys to wicked propaganda about our deities, through the internet, print media and lectures, and thus we see a decline in devotion and faith towards our deities. Also, we have been noticing every day that enthusiasm is waning in matters of observance of festivals, in which those deities are worshipped. So, feeling the need for a scientific enquiry and discernment, we have utilized a good part of this book, with an aim to set right such wrong notions.</p>
	<p>In this book we have reverentially used some words such as <i><strong>Sri Gurudeva</strong></i> (Holy Teacher), <i><strong>Maha Guru</strong></i> (Great Teacher). etc. The divine person thus referred to was one who bore the auspicious name <i><strong>&#x2018;Srirangamahaguru&#x2019;</strong></i>. He was noble person, a supreme Yogi, and a great soul satiated with divine knowledge and divine science. He hailed from a sacred place called &#x2018;Hedathale&#x2019; near the pilgrim center &#x2018;Nanjanagudu&#x2019;, near Mysore. He was a supreme preceptor who spiritually educated hundreds of blessed souls about Bharateeya Samskruti in a scientific way.</p>
	<p>Revered Sri Sampath Krishna Desikachar (younger brother of His Holiness the Swamiji in his previous stage of life) is a fatherly figure and an elderly person. He has special admiration and affection for Bharatha Darshana Publications. He has kindly graced all our endeavors and has been guiding us.</p>
	<p>Prof. Sri.K.S.Sridharan, a scholar in Sanskrit and Kannada is an amiable and an accomplished person. He was a student of His Holiness in the degree and postgraduate classes, and had the fortune of receiving the blessings and guidance of the venerable Swamiji in various aspects for over four decades. At our behest he undertook the difficult task of translating this book into English from the original in Kannada penned by His Holiness and has excellently brought forth the essence of Swamiji's words in this translation. Working hard for several months, he has completed this sacred task as a form of service to God. We are grateful to him for his invaluable and praiseworthy service done with great devotion and commitment.</p>
	<p>Dr.Hungi Papanna Eswara a neurologist by profession has worked in many Hospitals in the US. He was specially blessed by the grace of His Holiness. To serve His Holiness personally and to obtain guidance in spiritual life under his supervision, he quit his profession in the U.S. and returned to Bangalore . He served His Holiness for twelve years with full devotion. To bring this English translation to the present form from the summarised form, he has worked hard to incorporate all the points, and has provided invaluable inputs. We are grateful to him for his commendable work.</p> 
	<p>Sri Viswanatha sharma, a long time resident of USA, worked as a consultant electronics engineer for several prominent companies there. He has great respect for Bharatheeya Culture. He is an Initiate in &#x2018;Kriya Yoga&#x2019;, and has practiced it for several years. He has studied the works of Sriranga Mahaguru and the revered Swamiji. He has translated the introductory and concluding chapters of this book into English. We are grateful to him for the same.</p>
